# Dnd Encounter Simulator

## Introduction 

This was a project I completed for the end of module 1 of my IronHack Web Development Bootcamp. The deliverable was a game which met the following criteria.

- Render a game in the browser.
- Have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case.
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
- Use plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation (or HTML canvas for graphics).
- Have a repo on GitHub.
- Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
- Be deployed online using GitHub Pages so that anybody can play it.
 -Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
 
## Concept

I wanted to create a game and a tool which can allow a player to experience an authentic Dnd Style encounter without a Dungeon Master (the person in real life to controls and runs the game).
With this is mind the game is progressed by the player pressing the required buttons, but the tasks normally carried out by the Dungeon Master are done automatically and certain parts are even random.

## Deliverables

- A working game, built by you that runs in the browser.
- A deploy of your game in GitHub Pages.
- The URL of the GitHub repository for your game.
- The URL of the live game on the Internet.
- The URL of the slides for your game’s presentation.
- You must present your game during Project #1 final presentations (last day of Project #1 time).

## Playing the game

If you'd like to play the game in your browser:

- [Click Here](https://craigb2405.github.io/dndencounter/) to visit the game.
- Click the 'Travel to the forest' button to start your adventure.
- Click the 'Fight em!' button to start the encounter.
- You'll be given instructions on what dice to roll on the scroll.
- Click the button in the dice table to roll the dice.
- Player Stats will be added/removed from your dice rolls. You can see yours in the player stats table.
- The enemy will roll at the same time, whoever rolls the highest wins.
- A player can use a finite number of health potions to add health back.
- Whoever reaches 0 health first loses the encounter.
